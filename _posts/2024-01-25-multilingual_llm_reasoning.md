** My takeaways from this paper: **

* Curriculum Learning is an intuitive concept and the idea of bilingual training is an interesting way to improve LLM performance in non-English languages.
* A broader learning for me: Because Iâ€™m new to reading LLM papers, it took me a long time to understand the difference between few-shot examples vs instruction-tuning. But I now understand that instruction-tuning is when you fine-tune a model. And few-shot examples are when you just include a small number of examples in the prompt.
